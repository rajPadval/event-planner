Sure! Developing an event planner web app using React.js can be a great project. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

1. Set up the project:
   ✅- Install Node.js if you haven't already. React requires Node.js to run.
   ✅- Use `npx create-react-app event-planner` to create a new React project called "event-planner".
   ✅- Navigate to the project directory using `cd event-planner`.

2. Plan the app's structure: //TODO
   - Identify the main features of the event planner, such as creating events, managing guest lists, sending invitations, etc.
   - Determine the components you'll need, such as EventForm, GuestList, Invitation, etc.

3. Design the UI: //TODO 
   - Decide on a design framework or library to help you with the styling, such as Material-UI or Bootstrap.
   - Create the necessary components and design the user interface using HTML and CSS within the React components.

4. Set up the routing: //TODO
   - Install the `react-router-dom` package using `npm install react-router-dom`.
   - Define routes for different pages/views, such as event creation, event details, guest list, etc., using the `<Route>` component from `react-router-dom`.

5. Manage state with React Hooks: //TODO
   - Utilize React Hooks such as `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext` to manage the state of your application.
   - Define state variables for storing event data, guest lists, form inputs, etc.

6. Implement CRUD operations: //TODO
   - Create functionality to add new events, edit existing events, delete events, and view event details.
   - Implement guest list management features, such as adding guests, removing guests, and updating guest information.

7. Integrate with backend services: //TODO
   - Decide whether you want to use a backend service for storing data, such as Firebase or a custom server.
   - Set up API endpoints or utilize Firebase's Realtime Database or Firestore for storing and retrieving event and guest data.

8. Implement additional features: //TODO
   - Add features like sending invitations via email, generating event reports, setting reminders, and integrating with a calendar service.
   - Explore libraries or APIs that can help you with these functionalities, such as Nodemailer for sending emails or Google Calendar API for calendar integration.

9. Test and debug: //TODO
   - Use the development server provided by React (`npm start`) to test your app during development.
   - Debug any issues that arise, using tools like React DevTools and browser developer tools.

10. Deploy the app: //TODO
    - Once you're satisfied with the functionality and testing, build the production-ready version of your app using `npm run build`.
    - Deploy your app to a hosting service, such as Netlify, Vercel, or Firebase Hosting.

Remember to break down the development tasks into smaller, manageable steps and make use of React best practices and community resources like documentation, tutorials, and open-source projects. Good luck with your event planner project!
